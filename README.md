You can choose which arithmetic operation you'd like to perform on the rational numbers. You may choose to input the letter as lowercase or UPPERCASE. Both forms are accepted. 

If you input `A` or `a`, you will be prompted with the following menu:

_The same menu will be displayed if you input `S` or `s`. Only the words "addition/s" will be replaced with "subtraction/s"._

Addition of rational numbers

Please enter a fraction (n/d): 

Please enter a fraction (n/d):

The result of `n/d` and `n/d` = `result`

Do you want to do more additions? (Y/N):

The first line informs you of which operation you choose. The second and third lines propmt you for the input of two rational numbers.

>For example, you may enter `1/2` and `1/2`. 

The fourth line will display both fractions and the arithmetic operator you chose, and will output the `result` in its reduced form. 

>For example you will see the following: The result of `1/2` + `1/2` = 1

**Every fraction will be in its reduced form by the greatest common factor of both rational numbers.**

The fifth line will ask you if you want to continue doing arithmetic operations on rational numbers. *Notice that if you choose `A` the program will continue to add, and if you choose `S`, the program will proceed to subtract until you choose otherwise.* If you input `N` or `n`, you will be taken to the Rational Numbers Calculator menu. 

After you're taken back to the home menu, you may press `Q` or `q` to exit the program.
